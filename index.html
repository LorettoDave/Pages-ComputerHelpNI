						<p>After three and a half years in business, Computer Help NI is now closed. This venture has been thoroughly enjoyable and a constant learning experience, but it hasn’t generated much revenue. Therefore, when I received an excellent job offer, I accepted.</p>
						
						<p>I appreciate that good computer help can be difficult to find, so I’d like to make the following recommendations:</p>
						
						<p><strong>For home customers,</strong> I recommend David McAlinden of Respawn Repairs. David provides excellent on-site support for computers and mobile devices and operates the same “no fix, no fee” policy that my customers are accustomed to.</p>

						</ul>
						
						<p><strong>For business customers,</strong> I recommend Support IT NI. Their growing team of experienced IT staff provide excellent IT support and managed services for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
